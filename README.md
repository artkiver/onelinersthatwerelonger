# I have maintained codebases before CVS even existed.
# I have maintained CVS and SVN repositories.
# I have had meals with the author of hg.
# I do not need github.
# I prefer fossil-scm.
# Absolutely NO ONE needs github after Microsoft acquired them.
# Find other code sanctuaries, your data will remain in peril
# So long as there is a profit motive behind it.

# In more recent years.
# You may shed fewer tears.
# If you abandon the "hub" and git.
# We've "got" http://gameoftrees.org now if you want to get with IT?
# Am I Tea?
# or a mystery?
# Answers may lie.
# Beneath functionality.
# Feigning usability.
# While offering absurdity.
# I would like to get out of poverty.
# Yet debts and perpetual nomadic couch surfin' or homelessness are not foreign to me.
# Perhaps you care to provide some generosity?
# I do not support cryptocurrency.
# I also do not own a single NFT.
# Yet you may be able to use this, at least temporarily:
# Post pend "/rhymebyter" to https://www.paypal.me
# I like to leave at least a modest attempt, at anonymity.
# For even when I was consulting for iXSystems and helped patch an embargoed
# bug in BIND by ISC
# on some systems which were running FreeBSD
# I was still in debt, couch surfin' and strugglin' with poverty.
# If you think I am lyin' just look up 2013-4854 by CVE.
# PHRACK, after FIVE YEARS, didn't even get Dan Kaminsky's scene handle correct, a tragedy.
# Twitter remains a land of infamy.
# So I would suggest those who think PHRACK is still relevant may be graspin' at obscurity?
# Instead of offerin' helpful advancements to hackin' or patches for practitioners of security.
# There is more to existence than code and breakin' things down, enjoy some TEA!
