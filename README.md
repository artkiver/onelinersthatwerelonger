# I have maintained codebases before CVS even existed.
# I have maintained CVS and SVN repositories.
# I have had meals with the author of hg.
# I do not need github.
# I prefer fossil-scm.
# Absolutely NO ONE needs github after Microsoft acquired them.
# Find other code sanctuaries, your data will remain in peril
# So long as there is a profit motive behind it.
